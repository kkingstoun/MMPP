# Micro Magnetic Post Processing tool for Mumax and OOMMF
Mumax3, OOMMF and other numerical micromagnetic packages are doing an amazing job solving the LLG equation, however, it is not too easy to analyses data. Here I would like to present software called MMPP that has been developed by micromagnetic group from Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan for the analysis of large amounts of data produced by micromagnetic simulations. 

Features: 

1. Fast, multiprocessing ovf data decoding (100 GB < 2-3 minutes (depends on the HDD and CPU)).  
2. 2d and 3d data visualization.
3. FMR calculations, and modes visualization. 
4. Dispersion relation (not available yet). 
5. Dispersion modes visualization (not available yet).
6.  3DsMax and Blender compatibility for visualizations (not available yet).
