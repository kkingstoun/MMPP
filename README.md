# Micro Magnetic Post Processing tool for Mumax and OOMMF
Mumax3, OOMMF and other numerical micromagnetic packages are doing an amazing job solving the LLG equation, however, it is not too easy to analyses data. Here I would like to present software called MMPP that has been developed by micromagnetic group from Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan for the analysis of large amounts of data produced by micromagnetic simulations.

Features: 

1. Fast, multiprocessing ovf data decoding (100 GB < 2-3 minutes (depends on the HDD and CPU)).  
2. 2D and 3D data visualization (Matplotlib, Plotly*, Mayavi* support).
3. FMR, and modes visualization. 
4. Dispersion relation*. 
5. Interactive dispersion modes visualization*.
6. Isofrequency contours*.
7. 3DsMax and Blender compatibility for visualizations*.

**Will be published at the first release.*

**The first official release with full functionality will appear in December 2019.**
